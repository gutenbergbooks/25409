    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE story of the Sleeping Beauty is well known; we have excellent accounts
      of it, both in prose and in verse. I shall not undertake to relate-it
      again; but, having become acquainted with several memoirs of the time
      which have remained unpublished, I discovered some anecdotes relating to
      King Cloche and Queen Satine, whose daughter it was that slept a hundred
      years, and also to several members of the Court who shared the Princess&rsquo;s
      sleep. I propose to communicate to the public such portions of these
      revelations as have seemed to me most interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several years of marriage, Queen Satine gave the King, her husband,
      a daughter who received the names of Paule-Marie-Aurore. The baptismal
      festivities were planned by the Duc des Hoisons, grand master of the
      ceremonies, in accordance with a formulary dating from the Emperor
      Honorius, which was so mildewed and so nibbled by rats that it was
      impossible to decipher any of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were still fairies in those days, and those who had titles used to
      go to Court. Seven of them were invited to be god-mothers, Queen Titania,
      Queen Mab, the wise Vivien, trained by Merlin in the arts of enchantment,
      Melusina, whose history was written by Jean d&rsquo;Arras, and who became a
      serpent every Saturday (but the baptism was on a Sunday), Urg√®le, White
      Anna of Brittany, and Mourgue who led Ogier the Dane into the country of
      Avalon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appeared at the castle in robes of the colour of time, of the sun, of
      the moon, and of the nymphs, all glittering with diamonds and pearls. As
      all were taking their places at table an old fairy called Alcuine, who had
      not been invited, was seen to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not be annoyed, madame,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;that you were not of
      those invited to this festivity; it was believed that you were either dead
      or enchanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since the fairies grew old, there is no doubt that they used to die. They
      all died in time, and everybody knows that Melusina became a kitchen wench
      in Hell. By means of enchantment they could be imprisoned in a magic
      circle, a tree, a bush, or a stone, or changed into a statue, a hind, a
      dove, a footstool, a ring, or a slipper. But as a fact it was not because
      they thought her dead or enchanted that they had not invited the fairy
      Alcuine; it was because her presence at the banquet had been regarded as
      contrary to etiquette. Madame de Maintenon was able to state without the
      least exaggeration that &ldquo;there are no austerities in the convents like
      those to which Court etiquette subjects the great.&rdquo; In accordance with his
      sovereign&rsquo;s royal wish the Duc des Hoisons had not invited the fairy
      Alcuine, because she had one quartering of nobility too few to be admitted
      to Court. When the Ministers of State represented that it was of the
      utmost importance to humour this powerful and vindictive fairy, of whom
      they would make a dangerous enemy if they excluded her from the
      festivities, the King replied in peremptory tones that she could not be
      invited, as she was not qualified by birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unhappy monarch, even more than his predecessors, was a slave to
      etiquette. His obstinacy in subordinating the greatest interests and most
      urgent duties to the smallest exigencies of an obsolete ceremonial, had
      more than once caused serious loss to the monarchy, and had involved the
      realm in formidable perils. Of all these perils and losses, those to which
      Cloche had exposed his house by refusing to stretch a point of etiquette
      in favour of a fairy, without birth, yet formidable and illustrious, were
      by no means the hardest to foresee, nor was it least urgent to avert them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aged Alcuine, enraged by the contempt to which she had been subjected,
      bestowed upon the Princess Aurore a disastrous gift. At fifteen years of
      age, beautiful as the day, this royal child was to die of a fatal wound,
      caused by a spindle, an innocent weapon in the hands of mortal women, but
      a terrible one when the three spinstress Sisters twist and coil thereon
      the thread of our destinies and the strings of our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seven godmothers could modify, but could not annul Alcuine&rsquo;s decree,
      and thus the fate of the Princess was determined. &ldquo;Aurore will prick her
      hand with a spindle; she will not die of it, but will fall into a sleep of
      a hundred years, from which the son of a king will come to arouse her.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      ANXIOUSLY the King and Queen consulted, in respect of the decree
      pronounced upon the Princess in her cradle, all persons of learning and
      judgment, notably Monsieur Gerberoy, perpetual secretary of the Academy of
      Sciences, and Dr. Gastinel, the Queen&rsquo;s accoucheur. &ldquo;Monsieur Gerberoy,&rdquo;
       Satine inquired, &ldquo;can one really sleep a hundred years?&rdquo; &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo;
       answered the Academician, &ldquo;we have examples of sleep, more or less
      prolonged, some of which I can relate to Your Majesty. Epimenides of
      Cnossos was born of the loves of a mortal and a nymph. While yet a child
      he was sent by Dosiades, his father, to watch the flocks in the mountains.
      When the warmth of midday enveloped the earth, he laid himself down in a
      cool, dark cave, and there he fell into a slumber which lasted for
      fifty-seven years. He studied the virtues of the plants, and died,
      according to some, at the age of a hundred and fifty-four years; according
      to others at the age of two hundred and ninety-eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story of the seven sleepers of Ephesus is related by Theodore and
      Rufinus, in a manuscript sealed with two silver seals. Briefly expounded,
      these are the principal facts. In the year 25 of our Lord, seven of the
      officers of the Emperor Decius, who had embraced the Christian religion,
      distributed their goods to the poor, retired to Mount Celion, and there
      all seven fell asleep in a cave. During the reign of Theodore the Bishop
      of Ephesus found them there, blooming like roses. They had slept for one
      hundred and forty-four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederick Barbarossa is still asleep. In the crypt beneath a ruined
      castle, in the midst of a dense forest, he is seated before a table round
      which his beard has twisted seven times. He will awake to drive away the
      crows which croak around the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These, madame, are the greatest sleepers of whom History has kept a
      record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all exceptions,&rdquo; answered the Queen. &ldquo;You, Monsieur Gastinel,
      who practise medicine, have you ever seen people sleep a hundred years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; replied the accoucheur, &ldquo;I have not exactly seen any such,
      nor do I ever expect to do so; but I have seen some curious cases of
      lethargy, which, if you desire, I will bring to Your Majesty&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years ago a demoiselle Jeanne Caillou, being admitted to the
      H√¥tel-Dieu, there slept for six consecutive years. I myself observed the
      girl L√©onide Montauciel, who fell asleep on Easter Day in the year &lsquo;61,
      and did not awake until Easter Day of the following year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Gastinel,&rdquo; demanded the King, &ldquo;can the point of a spindle cause
      a wound which will send one to sleep for a hundred years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is not probable,&rdquo; answered Monsieur Gastinel, &ldquo;but in the domain
      of pathology, we can never say with certainty, &lsquo;This will or will not
      happen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might mention Brunhild,&rdquo; said Monsieur Gerberoy, &ldquo;who was pricked by
      a thorn, fell asleep, and was awakened by Sigurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was also Guenillon,&rdquo; said the Duchess of Cicogne, first
      lady-in-waiting to the Queen. And she hummed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     She was sent to the wood
     To gather some nuts,
     The bush was too high,
     The maid was too small.

     The bush was too high,
     The maid was too small,
     She pricked her poor hand
     With a very sharp thorn.

     She pricked her poor hand
     With a very sharp thorn,
     From the pain in her finger
     The maid fell asleep.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of, Cicogne?&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;You are singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty will forgive me,&rdquo; replied the Duchess. &ldquo;It was to ward off
      the bad luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King issued an edict, whereby all persons were forbidden under pain of
      death to spin with spindles, or even to have spindles in their possession.
      All obeyed. They still used to say in the country districts: &ldquo;The spindles
      must follow the mattock,&rdquo; but it was only by force of habit. The spindles
      had disappeared.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      MONSIEUR DE LA ROCHECOUP√âE, the Prime Minister who, under the feeble King
      Cloche, governed the kingdom, respected popular beliefs, as all great
      statesmen respect them. Caesar was Pontifex Maximus, and Napoleon had
      himself crowned by the Pope. Monsieur de La Rochecoup√©e admitted the power
      of the fairies. He was by no means sceptical, by no means incredulous. He
      did not suggest that the prediction of the seven godmothers was false.
      But, being helpless, he did not allow it to disturb him. His temperament
      was such that he did not worry about evils which he was impotent to
      remedy. In any case, so far as could be judged, the occurrence foretold
      was not imminent. Monsieur de La Rochecoup√©e viewed events as a statesman,
      and statesmen never look beyond the present moment. I am speaking of the
      shrewdest and most far-sighted. After all, supposing one day the King&rsquo;s
      daughter did fall asleep for a hundred years, it was, in his eyes, purely
      a family matter, seeing that women were excluded from the throne by the
      Salic Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, as he said, plenty of other fish to fry. Bankruptcy, hideous
      bankruptcy was ever present, threatening to consume the wealth and the
      honour of the nation. Famine was raging in the kingdom, and millions of
      unfortunate wretches were eating plaster instead of bread. That year the
      opera ball was more brilliant and the masques finer than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasantry, artisans, and shopkeepers, and the girls of the theatre,
      vied with one another in grieving over the fatal curse inflicted by
      Alcuine upon the innocent Princess. The lords of the Court, on the
      contrary, and the princes of the blood royal, appeared very indifferent to
      it. And there were on all hands men of business and students of science
      who did not believe in the award of the fairies, for the very good reason
      that they did not believe in fairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a one was Monsieur Boulingrin, Secretary of State for the Treasury.
      Those who ask how it was possible that he should not believe in them since
      he had seen them are unaware of the lengths to which scepticism can go in
      an argumentative mind. Nourished on Lucretius, imbued with the doctrines
      of Epicurus and Gassendi, he often provoked Monsieur de La Rochecoup√©e by
      the display of a cold disbelief in fairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister would say to him: &ldquo;If not for your own sake, be a
      believer for that of the public. Seriously, my dear Boulingrin, that there
      are moments when I wonder which of us two is the more credulous in respect
      of fairies. I never think of them, and you are always talking of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Boulingrin dearly loved the Duchess of Cicogne, wife of the
      ambassador to Vienna, first lady-in-waiting to the Queen, who belonged to
      the highest aristocracy of the realm; a witty woman, somewhat lean, and a
      trifle close, who was losing her income, her estates, and her very chemise
      at faro. She showed much kindness to Monsieur de Boulingrin, lending
      herself to an intercourse for which she had no temperamental inclination,
      but which she thought suitable to her rank, and useful to her interests.
      Their intrigue was conducted with an art which revealed their good taste,
      and the elegance of the prevailing morality; the connection was openly
      avowed, and thereby stripped of all base hypocrisy; but it was at the same
      time so reserved in appearance that even the severest critics saw no cause
      for censure in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time which the Duchess yearly spent on her estate, Monsieur de
      Boulingrin used to stay in an old pigeon-house, separated from his
      friend&rsquo;s ch√¢teau by a sunken road, which skirted a marsh, where by night
      the frogs among the reeds tuned their diligent voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, one evening when the last rays of the setting sun were dying the
      stagnant water with the hue of blood, the Secretary of State for the
      Treasury saw at the cross-roads three young fairies who were dancing in a
      circle and singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Trois filles dedans un pr√©
          Mon coeur vole
          Mon coeur vole
     Mon coeur vole √† votre gr√©.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They enclosed him within their circle, and their light and airy forms sped
      swiftly about him. Their faces, in the twilight, were dim and transparent;
      their tresses shone like the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp. They repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trois filles dedans un pr√©!&rdquo; until, dazed and ready to fall, he begged
      for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said the most beautiful, opening the circle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sisters, give leave to Monsieur de Boulingrin to pass, that he may go to
      the castle, and kiss his ladylove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on without having recognized the fairies, the mistresses of men&rsquo;s
      destinies, and a little farther on he met three old beggar women, who were
      walking bowed low over their sticks; their faces were like three apples
      roasted in the cinders. From their rags protruded bones which had more
      dirt than flesh upon them. Their naked feet ended in fleshless toes of
      immoderate length, like the bones of an ox-tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they saw him approaching they smiled upon him and threw him
      kisses; they stopped him on his way, calling him their darling, their
      love, their pet, and covered him with caresses which he was powerless to
      evade, for the moment he made a movement to escape, they dug into his
      flesh the sharp claws at the tips of their fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he handsome? Isn&rsquo;t he lovely?&rdquo; they sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time they raved on, begging him to love them. Then, seeing they
      could not rouse his senses, which were frozen with horror, they covered
      him with abuse, hammered him with their staves, threw him on the ground
      and trod him underfoot. Then, when he was crushed, broken, aching, and
      crippled in every limb, the youngest, who was at least eighty years of
      age, squatted upon him and treated him in a manner too infamous to
      describe. He was almost suffocated; immediately afterwards the other two,
      taking the place of the first, treated the unfortunate gentleman in the
      same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally all three made off, saluting him with: &ldquo;Good night, Endymion!&rdquo; &ldquo;To
      our next meeting, Adonis!&rdquo; &ldquo;Good-bye, beautiful Narcissus!&rdquo; and left him
      swooning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came back to his senses, a toad near him was whistling deliciously
      like a flute, and a cloud of mosquitoes were dancing before the moon. He
      rose with great difficulty and limpingly pursued his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again Monsieur de Boulingrin had failed to recognize the fairies,
      mistresses of the destinies of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Cicogne awaited him impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come very late, my friend,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered, as he kissed her fingers, that it was very kind of her to
      reproach him. His excuse was that he had been somewhat unwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boulingrin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;sit down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she confided to him that she would be very happy to accept from the
      royal treasury a present of two thousand crowns, as a fitting compensation
      for the unkindness of fate, faro having for the last six months been
      terribly against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Informed that the matter was urgent, Boulingrin wrote immediately to
      Monsieur de La Rochecoup√©e to ask for the necessary sum of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Rochecoup√©e will be delighted to obtain it for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is a
      helpful person and takes pleasure in serving his friends. I may add that
      in him one perceives greater talents than are commonly seen in the
      favourites of Princes. He has taste, and a head for business; but he is
      lacking in philosophy. He believes in fairies, relying on his senses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boulingrin,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;you stink like a tom-cat.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      SEVENTEEN years, day by day, had elapsed since the fairies&rsquo; decree. The
      Princess was as beautiful as a star. The King, Queen, and Court were in
      residence at the rural palace of Eaux-Perdues. Need I relate what happened
      then? It is well known how the Princess Aurore, wandering one day through
      the castle, came to the top of a keep, where, in a garret, she found a
      dear old woman, all alone, plying her distaff. She had never heard of the
      King&rsquo;s regulations, forbidding the use of spindles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, my good woman?&rdquo; asked the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am spinning, my dear child,&rdquo; replied the old woman, who did not
      recognize her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how pretty it looks,&rdquo; replied the Princess. &ldquo;How do you do it? Give
      it to me, that I may see if I can do it as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had she picked up the spindle, than she pricked her hand with
      it, and fell swooning.{*} King Cloche, when he heard that the fairies&rsquo; 
      decree had been accomplished, ordered that the sleeping Princess should be
      placed in the Blue Chamber, on a bed of azure embroidered with silver.
      Shocked, and full of consternation, the courtiers made ready to weep,
      practised sighing, and assumed an expression of deep affliction. Intrigues
      were formed in every direction; it was reported that the King had
      discharged his Ministers. The blackest calumnies were hatched. It was said
      that the Duc de La Rochecoup√©e had concocted a draught to send the
      Princess to sleep, and that Monsieur de Boulingrin was his accomplice.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      The Duchess of Cicogne climbed the secret staircase to the chambers of her
      old friend, whom she found in his night-cap, smiling, for he was reading
      <i>La Fianc√©e du roi de Garbe</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicogne told him the news, and how the Princess was lying on a blue bed in
      a state of lethargy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary of State listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not believe, I hope, my dear friend, that the fairies have
      anything to do with it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he did not believe in fairies, although three of them, ancient and
      venerable, had overpowered him with their love and their staves, and had
      drenched him to the skin in a disgusting liquid, in order to prove their
      existence to him. The defect of the experimental method pursued by these
      ladies is that the experiment was addressed to the senses, whose testimony
      one can always challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fairies have had everything to do with it!&rdquo; cried the Duchess. &ldquo;The
      Princess&rsquo;s accident may have the most unfortunate results for you and for
      me. People will not fail to attribute it to the incapacity of the
      Ministers, and possibly to their malevolence. Can one tell how far calumny
      may reach? You are already accused of niggardliness. According to what is
      being said, you refused, on my advice, to pay for warders for the young
      and unfortunate Princess. Worse than that, there are rumours of black
      magic, of casting spells. The storm has got to be faced. Show yourself, or
      you are lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calumny,&rdquo; said Boulingrin, &ldquo;is the curse of this world. It has killed the
      greatest of men. Whoever honestly serves his King must make up his mind to
      pay tribute to that crawling, flying horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boulingrin,&rdquo; said Cicogne, &ldquo;get dressed.&rdquo; And she snatched off his
      night-cap, and threw it down by the bed-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later they were in the antechamber of the apartment in which
      Aurore was sleeping, and seating themselves on a bench they waited to be
      introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at the news that the decree of the Fates had been accomplished, the
      fairy Vivien, one of the Princess&rsquo;s godmothers, repaired in great haste to
      Eaux-Perdues, and in order that when she awoke her god-daughter should
      have a Court she touched every one in the castle with her ring.
      &ldquo;Governesses, maids of honour, women of the bedchamber, noblemen,
      officers, grooms of the chamber, cooks, scullions, messengers, guards,
      beadles, pages, and footmen; she also touched the horses in the stables,
      the grooms, the great mastiffs in the yard, and little Pouffe, the
      Princess&rsquo;s lap-dog, which lay near her upon her bed. The very spits in
      front of the fire, loaded with pheasants and partridges, went to
      sleep.&rdquo; {*}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Contes de Perrault, √©dition Aadr√© Lefevre, p. 87
</pre>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Cicogne and Boulingrin waited side by side upon their bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boulingrin,&rdquo; whispered the Duchess in her old friend&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;does it not
      seem to you that there is something suspicious in this business? Don&rsquo;t you
      suspect an intrigue on the part of the King&rsquo;s brothers to get the poor man
      to abdicate? He is well known as a good father. They may well have wished
      to throw him into despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; answered the Secretary of State. &ldquo;In any case the
      fairies have nothing whatever to do with the matter. Only old countrywomen
      can still believe these cock-and-bull stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Boulingrin,&rdquo; said the Duchess. &ldquo;There is nothing so hateful as
      a sceptic. He is an impertinent person who laughs at our simplicity. I
      detest strong-minded people; I believe what I ought to believe; but in
      this particular case, I suspect a dark intrigue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Cicogne spoke these words, the fairy Vivien touched
      them both with her ring, and sent them to sleep like the rest.

      IN a quarter of an hour there grew all round about the park such an
      immense quantity of trees, large and small, with thorns and briars
      interlaced,-that neither man nor beast could pass; so that only the tops
      of the castle towers could be seen, and these only from a long way off.{*}
      Once, twice, thrice, fifty, sixty, eighty, ninety, and a hundred times did
      Urania close the circle of Time: the Sleeping Beauty and her Court, with
      Boulingrin beside the Duchess on the bench in the antechamber, still slept
      on.

    <p>
      Whether one regard Time as a mode of the unique substance, whether it be
      defined as one of the forms of the conscious ego, or an abstract phase of
      the immediate externality, or whether one regard it purely as a law, a
      relation resulting from the progression of Reality, we can affirm that one
      hundred years is a certain space of time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      EVERY one knows the end of the enchantment, and how, after a hundred
      terrestrial cycles, a prince favoured by the fairies penetrated the
      enchanted wood, and reached the bed where slept the Princess. He was a
      little German princeling, with a pretty moustache, and rounded hips. As
      soon as she woke up, she fell, or rather rose so much in love, that she
      followed him to his little principality in such a hurry that she never
      said a word to the people of her household, who had slept with her for a
      hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first lady-in-waiting was quite touched thereby, and exclaimed with
      admiration: &ldquo;I recognize the blood of my kings.&rdquo; Boulingrin woke up beside
      the Duchess de Cicogne at the same time as the Princess and all her
      household. As he rubbed his eyes, his mistress said: &ldquo;Boulingrin, you have
      been asleep.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not at all, dear lady, not at all.&rdquo; He spoke in good faith.
      Having slept without dreaming for a hundred years, he did not know that he
      had been asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been so little asleep,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I can repeat what you said
      a minute ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said, &lsquo;I suspect a dark intrigue.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it awoke, the whole of the little Court was discharged; every
      one had to fend for himself as best he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boulingrin and Cicogne hired from the castle steward an old
      seventeenth-century trap drawn by an animal which was already very aged
      before it went to sleep for a hundred years, and drove to the station of
      Eaux-Perdues, where they caught a train which, in two hours, deposited
      them in the capital of the country. Great was their surprise at all that
      they saw and heard. But by the end of a quarter of an hour they had
      exhausted their astonishment, and nothing surprised them any more. As for
      themselves, nobody took the slightest interest in them. Their story was
      perfectly incomprehensible, and awakened no curiosity, for our minds are
      not interested in anything that is too obvious, or too difficult to
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one may well believe, Boulingrin had not the remotest idea what had
      happened to him. But when the Duchess said that it was not natural, he
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lady, allow me to observe that you have been badly trained in
      physics. Nothing exists which is not according to Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There remained to them neither friends, relations, nor property. They
      could not identify the position of their house. With the little money they
      had they bought a guitar, and sang in the streets. By this means they
      gained sufficient to support themselves. At night Cicogne staked at
      manille, in the inns, the coppers that had been thrown her during the day,
      while Boulingrin, with a bowl of warm wine in front of him, explained to
      the company that it was ridiculous to believe in fairies.
